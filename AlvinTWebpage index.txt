      <h3 style="text-align:center"> About Me </h3>

      <p style="text-align:center">
        Hello my name is Alvin Tarpeh welcome to my home page. I am 28 years old, a college student<br>
        who attends BMCC. I am looking to obtain my Associate Degree in Computer Science.<br>
        I attend school 4 days out of the week and I also work 5 days out of the week. <br>
        My hobbie is boxing, I love boxing it has been the sport I've loved since I was 18. <br> 
        My older brother and younger brother introduced me to the sport because at that time I <br>
        had a lot of anger problems and my family thought boxing would be a great solution to my problems.
       </p>

       <p style="text-align:center">
        I had been training for 6 years until I tore my rotater cuffs in my left shoulder during sparring. <br>
        I was unable to train for three years because of this accident. My doctor told me that I would not <br>
        be able to compete until it is completetly healed. I was devasted and ultimately gained 200 pounds due to not being able to train.
       </p>

       <p style="text-alignment:center"> 
         A little bit more about me is that my favorite color is <span  style="color:blue">blue</span>.<br>
         I am one of 10 children and I am also a <big>twin</big>. My favorite food is pizza and I love my girlfriend <br>
         of two years who is the most awesomest person in the world.
